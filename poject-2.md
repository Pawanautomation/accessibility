Let me share a detailed approach to accessibility testing using a combination of manual and automated testing.

1. Project Context:
"In my previous role, I worked on an e-commerce platform that needed to be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. The platform included complex features like a product catalog, shopping cart, checkout process, and user account management."

2. Automated Testing Approach:
"I implemented a multi-layered automated testing strategy:

a) Used Axe DevTools for initial scanning:
- Integrated Axe-core into our CI/CD pipeline
- Created custom rules for business-specific components
- Set up automated scans for:
  * Color contrast issues
  * Missing alternative text
  * Form label associations
  * ARIA attribute validation
  * Heading hierarchy

b) Regular automated checks:
- Scheduled daily automated scans of production environment
- Generated trend reports to track improvements
- Set up alerts for critical accessibility violations"

3. Manual Testing Strategy:
"While automated testing caught many issues, manual testing was crucial for:

a) Keyboard Navigation Testing:
- Verified all interactive elements were focusable
- Checked focus order was logical and matched visual layout
- Tested keyboard traps
- Verified skip links functionality
- Ensured modal dialogs trapped focus correctly

b) Screen Reader Testing:
- Used NVDA with Firefox
- JAWS with Chrome
- VoiceOver on Safari
- Tested:
  * Form completion flows
  * Dynamic content updates
  * Error messages
  * Price and product information
  * Shopping cart updates

c) Cognitive Accessibility:
- Verified clear error messages
- Checked form completion time limits
- Tested timeout warnings
- Validated consistent navigation
- Assessed readability of content"

4. Test Documentation and Reporting:
"Created comprehensive test documentation:
- Detailed test cases for both manual and automated tests
- Screenshot evidence of issues
- Screen reader behavior recordings
- Priority-based issue categorization
- Remediation recommendations"

5. Results and Impact:
"The combined approach helped us:
- Identify 87% more issues than automated testing alone
- Reduce accessibility violations by 92% over 6 months
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Improve overall user experience for all users
- Prevent accessibility regressions through automated checks"

6. Process Improvements:
"Based on learnings, we:
- Created an accessibility testing checklist
- Developed component-level accessibility requirements
- Integrated accessibility testing earlier in development cycle
- Conducted developer training on common issues
- Built a library of accessible components"

7. Challenges and Solutions:
"Key challenges included:
- Complex dynamic content updates
- Third-party components with accessibility issues
- Custom widget implementations

Solutions:
- Implemented custom ARIA live regions for dynamic updates
- Created accessible alternatives for problematic third-party components
- Developed accessible widget patterns library"

8. Tools Used:
- Axe DevTools
- WAVE
- Color Contrast Analyzer
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Browser developer tools
- Keyboard testing tools

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this testing approach or share more details about particular testing scenarios?
