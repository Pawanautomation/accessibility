Interview question:Explain how you did the accessibility testing using mix of manual and automation testing.Explain in detail taking any project related to education like university etc as an example
Let me explain accessibility testing for a university's online learning management system (LMS) that needed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

1. Project Context:
"I worked on comprehensive accessibility testing for a university's learning platform that included:
- Course enrollment system
- Digital course materials
- Assignment submission portal
- Discussion forums
- Virtual classroom integration
- Student gradebook
- Course calendar
- Library resource access"

2. Automated Testing Implementation:

a) Initial Setup:
"We integrated Axe DevTools into our testing workflow:
- Created test scripts for high-traffic student journeys
- Set up automated daily scans of the live environment
- Configured custom rules for education-specific components like:
  * Math equation renderers
  * Interactive quiz elements
  * PDF document viewers
  * Video player accessibility"

b) Continuous Monitoring:
"Implemented automated checks for:
- Document structure and heading hierarchy
- Alt text for educational images and diagrams
- Form labels and instructions
- Color contrast in learning materials
- Table headers and relationships
- Link text meaningfulness
- PDF document accessibility
- Video caption presence"

3. Manual Testing Process:

a) Screen Reader Testing:
"Conducted comprehensive testing with multiple screen readers:
- NVDA for Windows users
- JAWS for faculty requirements
- VoiceOver for Mac users
Testing focused on:
- Course navigation structure
- Assignment submission workflows
- Math equation readability
- Table data comprehension
- Forum post interactions
- PDF document navigation"

b) Keyboard Navigation:
"Verified accessibility for keyboard-only users:
- Course content navigation
- Quiz and assessment completion
- Discussion forum participation
- Document library browsing
- Virtual classroom controls
- Calendar event creation
- Grade viewing interfaces"

c) Cognitive Accessibility:
"Focused on student-specific needs:
- Clear assignment instructions
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Readable content structure
- Time extension mechanisms for assessments
- Clear error identification in submissions
- Progress indicators for long processes"

4. Education-Specific Testing:

a) Digital Learning Materials:
"Tested accessibility of:
- Interactive learning modules
- Video lectures with captions
- Audio transcripts
- Downloadable resources
- Mathematical formulas
- Scientific diagrams
- Course handouts"

b) Assessment Tools:
"Verified accessibility of:
- Online quizzes
- Timed examinations
- File upload interfaces
- Feedback mechanisms
- Grade displays
- Progress tracking"

5. Results and Improvements:

a) Key Findings:
"Identified and resolved:
- Math equation rendering issues with screen readers
- PDF accessibility barriers
- Quiz timer accessibility problems
- Video player keyboard control issues
- Complex table navigation challenges"

b) Impact:
"Achieved:
- 95% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Improved student satisfaction scores
- Reduced accommodation requests
- Better learning experience for all students"

6. Documentation and Training:

"Created:
- Accessibility guidelines for content creators
- Training materials for faculty
- Student accessibility guides
- Testing checklists for new features
- Regular compliance reports"

7. Tools Used:
- Axe DevTools for automated scanning
- NVDA and JAWS screen readers
- Color Contrast Analyzer
- PDF Accessibility Checker
- MathML validators
- Caption quality checkers

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the educational platform testing or discuss particular challenges we encountered with academic content accessibility?
