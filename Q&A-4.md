**Q: Can you describe a challenging accessibility issue you encountered in a retail application and how you resolved it?**

A: In a recent project for a large e-commerce platform, we faced a complex issue with the product filtering system. The dynamic updates of search results were not being announced to screen reader users, making it difficult for them to navigate the product catalog efficiently. To resolve this, I worked closely with the development team to implement ARIA live regions that announced result updates. We also enhanced keyboard navigation and ensured proper focus management. This solution significantly improved the shopping experience for users relying on assistive technologies.

**Q: How do you prioritize accessibility issues when working on multiple projects simultaneously?**

A: When managing multiple projects, I prioritize issues based on their impact on user experience and legal compliance. I use a matrix that considers factors such as the number of users affected, the severity of the barrier, and the effort required to fix the issue. Critical issues that violate legal requirements or completely block access for certain user groups are always addressed first. I also consider project deadlines and coordinate with stakeholders to ensure a balanced approach that maximizes accessibility improvements across all projects.

## Soft Skills and Communication

**Q: How do you explain technical accessibility concepts to non-technical stakeholders?**

A: When communicating with non-technical stakeholders, I focus on the user impact and business benefits of accessibility. I use real-world examples and demonstrations to illustrate how accessibility features benefit all users, not just those with disabilities. For instance, I might show how captions help users in noisy environments or how keyboard navigation improves efficiency for power users. I avoid jargon and technical details unless specifically asked, instead emphasizing how accessibility aligns with broader business goals like increased user satisfaction and market reach.

**Q: In an agile environment, how do you ensure accessibility is considered throughout the development process?**

A: To integrate accessibility into an agile workflow, I advocate for including it in the definition of done for each user story. I work closely with product owners to incorporate accessibility requirements into user stories and acceptance criteria. During sprint planning, I provide input on potential accessibility impacts of proposed features. I also conduct regular accessibility checkpoints throughout the sprint, offering guidance to developers and designers. By making accessibility a continuous consideration rather than an afterthought, we can deliver more inclusive products efficiently.
