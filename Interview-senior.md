from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://example.com/accessibility-form")

# Check if the form has labels associated with inputs
inputs = driver.find_elements_by_tag_name('input')
for input in inputs:
    label = driver.find_element_by_xpath(f"//label[@for='{input.get_attribute('id')}']")
    assert label is not None, "Input field is missing an associated label"

driver.quit()
```
