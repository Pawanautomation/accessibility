# Accessibility Testing Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to accessibility testing using React, TypeScript, Playwright, and axe-core. The project is structured in multiple stages to showcase the identification, testing, and remediation of common accessibility issues.

## Stage 1: Creating Application with Accessibility Issues

### Initial Application Setup
- Created using Vite + React + TypeScript
- Basic web application with common UI elements
- Intentionally implemented with accessibility issues for testing purposes

### Intentional Accessibility Issues
1. **Missing Main Landmark**
   - Issue: No semantic structure with `<main>` element
   - Impact: Screen readers cannot identify main content area
   - WCAG Violation: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships

2. **Improper Heading Hierarchy**
   - Issue: Page starts with `<h3>` instead of `<h1>`
   - Impact: Disrupted document outline
   - WCAG Violation: 2.4.6 Headings and Labels

3. **Poor Color Contrast**
   - Issue: Light gray text (#999) on white background
   - Impact: Difficult to read for users with visual impairments
   - WCAG Violation: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)

4. **Non-Semantic Button Element**
   - Issue: Using `<div>` instead of `<button>`
   - Impact: Not keyboard accessible, missing role information
   - WCAG Violation: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value

5. **Form Input Without Labels**
   - Issue: Input fields missing proper labels
   - Impact: Screen readers cannot identify input purpose
   - WCAG Violation: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions

6. **Dynamic Content Without ARIA Live**
   - Issue: Updated content not announced to screen readers
   - Impact: Users miss dynamic content updates
   - WCAG Violation: 4.1.3 Status Messages

7. **Image Without Alt Text**
   - Issue: Missing alternative text for images
   - Impact: Screen readers cannot describe image content
   - WCAG Violation: 1.1.1 Non-text Content

8. **Table Without Proper Headers**
   - Issue: Table cells not properly associated with headers
   - Impact: Difficult to understand table structure
   - WCAG Violation: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships

## Stage 2: Setting Up Accessibility Testing (Next Steps)

### Planned Implementation
1. Install and configure Playwright with axe-core
2. Create E2E tests for accessibility violations
3. Setup automated accessibility reports
4. Configure CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing

### Testing Framework Setup
```bash
# To be implemented:
npm install -D @playwright/test axe-core @axe-core/playwright
```

## Stage 3: Fixing Accessibility Issues (Future Stage)

### Planned Improvements
1. Add proper semantic structure
2. Fix heading hierarchy
3. Improve color contrast
4. Replace div with button element
5. Add proper form labels
6. Implement ARIA live regions
7. Add alt text to images
8. Implement proper table structure

## Stage 4: Verification Testing (Final Stage)

### Planned Verification
1. Run updated accessibility tests
2. Generate comparison reports
3. Verify all WCAG criteria are met
4. Document improvements and compliance
