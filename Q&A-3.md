Simulated Technical Interview for Accessibility Testing Consultant
Interviewer:
Introduction: "Thank you for joining us today. We're excited to learn more about your experience in accessibility testing. To start, can you walk us through your typical approach to testing a web application for accessibility?"
Candidate:
Response: "Certainly! My approach involves a multi-faceted strategy:


Understanding Requirements: I begin by thoroughly reviewing the accessibility requirements, standards (WCAG 2.1), and any specific guidelines provided by the organization.
Manual Testing: I conduct manual testing to assess:
Keyboard navigation: Ensuring all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only the keyboard.
Screen reader compatibility: Testing with various screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA) to verify correct reading order, labeling, and navigation.
Color contrast: Using tools and manual checks to ensure sufficient contrast for readability.
Alternative text: Verifying that all non-text elements (images, videos) have appropriate alternative text.
Automated Testing: I leverage automated tools like Axe DevTools and Axe Auditor to efficiently identify and fix common accessibility issues. These tools can scan the code and provide detailed reports on violations of WCAG guidelines.
Regular Testing: I incorporate accessibility testing into the development lifecycle, conducting regular checks during development and testing phases.
Collaboration: I collaborate closely with developers, designers, and content creators to ensure accessibility is prioritized from the outset.
Interviewer:
Scenario-Based Question: "Imagine you encounter a complex component, like a custom data table, that doesn't pass accessibility tests. How would you approach troubleshooting and resolving the issue?"
Candidate:
Response: "I would follow these steps:


Identify the Issue: I would use automated tools to pinpoint the specific accessibility violations related to the data table.
Analyze the Code: I would examine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to understand the structure and behavior of the table.
Consult WCAG Guidelines: I would refer to the relevant WCAG guidelines (e.g., table structure, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility) to determine the necessary fixes.
Implement Solutions: I would work with the development team to implement the following solutions:
Ensure proper table markup (e.g., <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td>) and appropriate use of scope and headers attributes.
Provide clear and concise header labels for each column.
Enable keyboard navigation for table cells.
Ensure screen readers can correctly read and interpret the table structure and content.
Retest and Iterate: I would retest the component with automated tools and manual techniques to verify the fixes and ensure full accessibility. If necessary, I would iterate on the solutions until the component meets accessibility standards.
Interviewer:
Technical Question: "Can you explain the role of ARIA attributes in improving web accessibility?"
Candidate:
Response: "ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes provide additional semantic information to assistive technologies, helping them to understand and interpret complex web content. Here are some key ARIA attributes and their uses:


role: Defines the role of an element (e.g., role="button", role="tablist").
aria-label: Provides a textual label for an element.
aria-labelledby: References the ID of an element that provides a label.
aria-describedby: References the ID of an element that provides a description.
aria-live: Indicates whether an element's content is dynamically updated and should be announced by screen readers.
aria-required: Indicates whether an input field is required.
By using ARIA attributes appropriately, we can make web content more accessible to users with disabilities, especially those who rely on screen readers."
