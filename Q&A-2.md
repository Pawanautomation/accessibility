Simulated Technical Interview Questions and Sample Answers:

Introduction
Interviewer: Tell us about yourself and your experience with accessibility testing.
Candidate (Pawan): "I have over 6 years of experience in software testing, with a strong focus on accessibility testing for the last 5 years. My expertise includes ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards and accessibility regulations like ADA and Section 508. I am certified in accessibility testing (CPACC) and have hands-on experience with tools like Axe DevTools and Axe Auditor. I have worked extensively on both web and mobile applications, collaborating with teams to deliver accessible solutions for retail applications. I am also proficient in using screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA and have strong documentation and stakeholder communication skills."

Technical Knowledge Questions
Interviewer: Can you explain the difference between WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1?
Pawan: "WCAG 2.1 builds upon WCAG 2.0 and introduces additional success criteria focused on improving accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, users with low vision, and mobile device users. WCAG 2.1 includes 17 new success criteria across the levels A, AA, and AAA. For example, it introduces criteria like ‘Orientation’ (1.3.4) and ‘Label in Name’ (2.5.3), which were not part of WCAG 2.0. Both standards maintain the same principles—Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR)."

Interviewer: How would you test a retail web application for accessibility compliance?
Pawan: "I follow a structured approach for accessibility testing:
Initial Audit: Perform automated testing using tools like Axe DevTools to identify high-level issues.
Manual Testing: Use assistive technologies like screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA) to test navigation, form labels, and dynamic content.
WCAG Mapping: Map findings against WCAG 2.1 success criteria to ensure compliance.
Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all functionalities are accessible via keyboard alone.
Color Contrast and Visual Testing: Verify that color contrasts meet WCAG standards using tools like Colour Contrast Analyser.
Usability Testing: Engage with users with disabilities to validate real-world accessibility.
Reporting: Document findings, prioritize issues, and provide actionable recommendations."

Interviewer: Can you describe the role of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) in accessibility?
Pawan: "ARIA enhances the accessibility of dynamic web content by providing roles, states, and properties to assistive technologies. For example, ARIA roles like button, dialog, or alert help screen readers interpret the purpose of elements. However, ARIA should be used sparingly and only when native HTML elements cannot achieve the same result, as native HTML is inherently more accessible. Misusing ARIA can introduce accessibility issues, so careful testing is required."

Practical Scenarios
Interviewer: How would you address a scenario where an interactive component is not accessible via keyboard navigation?
Pawan: "First, I would inspect the DOM structure to ensure the interactive element has a tabindex set correctly. If necessary, I would recommend adding ARIA roles or modifying the HTML to make it keyboard-accessible. I would then test the functionality to ensure it adheres to WCAG guidelines and provide detailed feedback to the development team for implementation."

Interviewer: What challenges have you faced in accessibility testing, and how did you overcome them?
Pawan: "One major challenge is ensuring buy-in from stakeholders who may not initially prioritize accessibility. I address this by highlighting the legal implications of non-compliance and demonstrating the business value of inclusivity. Another challenge is testing dynamic components like modals and carousels. I mitigate this by closely collaborating with developers and using tools like Axe Auditor and manual testing to ensure compliance. Regular knowledge-sharing sessions also help foster a culture of accessibility within the team."

Behavioral Questions
Interviewer: How do you handle tight deadlines while maintaining the quality of accessibility testing?
Pawan: "I prioritize tasks based on impact, focusing on critical user flows and high-visibility components. I leverage automation tools like Axe DevTools for quick initial assessments and focus manual testing efforts on areas automation cannot fully cover. Effective communication with stakeholders and developers ensures alignment on priorities and expectations, enabling us to deliver quality results even under tight deadlines."

Interviewer: How do you approach working with developers and designers to fix accessibility issues?
Pawan: "I believe in a collaborative approach. I conduct regular meetings with developers and designers to explain accessibility issues, their impact on users, and provide actionable recommendations. I also share resources and best practices to help them build accessibility into their workflows. Pair programming sessions have been particularly effective in addressing complex issues."

Hands-On Exercise
Interviewer: We have a retail application with a checkout form. The form has a field without a proper label. How would you test and fix this issue?
Pawan: "First, I would test the field with a screen reader to confirm the label is missing or incorrect. Then, I would inspect the code to check for missing label tags or ARIA attributes like aria-labelledby. To fix the issue, I would recommend adding a label element linked to the field via the for attribute or using aria-labelledby to associate the field with a visible label. After fixing, I would retest with a screen reader and ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 (Success Criterion 3.3.2)."

Closing
Interviewer: Do you have any questions for us?
Pawan: "Yes, I’d like to understand how accessibility testing is integrated into the development lifecycle in your organization. Also, are there any specific accessibility challenges you’re currently facing that I could help address if selected for this role?"

Good luck, Pawan!
