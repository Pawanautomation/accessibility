- Real project examples where they identified and resolved accessibility issues
- Understanding of the four main principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust

2. "We use Axe DevTools extensively in our testing process. Can you explain how you would use it to test a complex web application, and what are its limitations?"

Expected good answer would include:
- Experience with both automated and manual testing using Axe DevTools
- Understanding of false positives and how to handle them
- Knowledge of how to interpret results and prioritize issues
- Experience with creating custom rules if needed

3. "Tell me about a challenging accessibility issue you encountered and how you resolved it."

Expected good answer would include:
- Clear problem description
- Systematic approach to troubleshooting
- Collaboration with developers

7. "A developer has implemented a custom dropdown menu. What would be your approach to testing its accessibility?"

Expected good answer would include:
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- ARIA roles and properties
- Mobile accessibility considerations

8. "What experience do you have with creating accessibility testing documentation and reports? How do you present findings to different stakeholders?"

Expected good answer would include:
- Experience with different reporting formats
- Priority classification of issues
- Clear communication of technical issues to non-technical stakeholders
- Documentation of remediation recommendations

9. "How do you stay current with accessibility standards and best practices?"

Expected good answer would include:
