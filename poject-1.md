In a recent e-commerce website project, I implemented a comprehensive accessibility testing strategy using a combination of manual and automated testing methods. Here's how I approached it:

## Automated Testing

1. HTML Validation: I started by using the W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure the HTML was valid and well-formed.

2. Browser Extensions: I utilized browser extensions like axe DevTools, WAVE, and Lighthouse to quickly identify common accessibility issues.

3. CI/CD Integration: I integrated automated accessibility checks into our Jenkins CI/CD pipeline using Pa11y-ci. This tool ran accessibility tests on every code commit, providing immediate feedback to developers.

## Manual Testing

After addressing issues found through automated testing, I conducted manual tests:

1. Keyboard Navigation: I navigated the entire website using only the keyboard, ensuring all interactive elements were reachable and operable.

2. Screen Reader Testing: Using NVDA and VoiceOver, I went through key user journeys to ensure content was properly announced and navigable.

3. Color Contrast: I manually reviewed color combinations across the site, particularly for text and interactive elements, to ensure sufficient contrast ratios.

4. Content Structure: I examined the logical structure of content, including proper use of headings, lists, and ARIA landmarks.

5. Form Accessibility: I tested all forms for proper labeling, error handling, and keyboard operability.

## User Testing

To complement the technical testing, we involved users with disabilities:

1. We recruited a diverse group of users, including those with visual, motor, and cognitive impairments.

2. Participants performed specific tasks on the website while we observed and gathered feedback.

3. This provided invaluable insights into real-world usability issues that automated and expert manual testing might have missed.

By combining these methods, we were able to identify and address a wide range of accessibility issues, resulting in a more inclusive and user-friendly e-commerce platform[1][3][5].
